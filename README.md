Local Weather
=============

- Uses Google Maps JS Browser API (will need to provide own key if running outside of CodePen) and Forecast.io (exposed for educational purposes, has 1k daily quota).

- Please note that navigator.geolocation requires https:// when using Chrome or you won't get a prompt to share your location.

- Saves temperature units setting to localStorage. IE/Edge does not allow local use of localStorage, but viewing the CodePen link in IE/Edge will work.

- Icons edited from http://all-free-download.com/free-vector/vector-icon/cartoon_weather_icon_01_vector_180133.html

- Includes Gulp build scripts.
